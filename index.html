    <h1>History of Bhagalpur</h1>
    <p>Bhagalpur is a city in the Indian state of Bihar, situated on the southern banks of the river Ganges. It is the
        2nd
        largest city of Bihar by population and also the headquarters of Bhagalpur district and Bhagalpur division.
        Known as the
        Silk City, it is a major educational, commercial, and political center, and listed for development under the
        Smart City
        program, a joint venture between Government and industry. The Gangetic plains surrounding the city are very
        fertile and
        the main crops include rice, wheat, maize, barley, and oilseeds. The river is home to the Gangetic dolphin, the
        National
        Aquatic Animal of India,[8] and the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary is established near the town. The
